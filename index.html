			<h1> The Cornell Crime Logs </h1>
			<p id="tagline"> By <a href="https://twitter.com/bean_doh">Beatrice Jin</a> </p>
			<p> Like many other universities (e.g. <a href="https://police.wustl.edu/Pages/Daily-Crime-Log-Archive.aspx">Washington University</a>, <a href="https://police.psu.edu/daily-crime-log"> Penn State </a>, <a href="https://www.mansfield.edu/police/press-releases.cfm"> Mansfield University</a>), Cornell University keeps a <a href = "https://dailycrimelog.cupolice.cornell.edu/index.cfm"> public log </a> of crimes and alleged crimes reported to the Cornell University Police Department. The log is published almost daily, but few people know about it. As of today, <a href="https://twitter.com/NickAtNews">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</a> remains the only person who tweets from the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CornellCrimeLog?src=hash">#CornellCrimeLog</a>. This visualization is an attempt to make this information more accessible to the public. </p>

			<p> The following two interactive graphs show the number of reported incidents that occur each day. In the top chart, weekends are in grey. They often have relatively high reported incidents, many which are alcohol related. There seems to be a spike in reports right before Halloween, despite Kathy Zoner's impassioned weekend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/cornell-university-police-department/halloween-safety/1601703096554383/">email</a>.</p>

			<p> Larceny (generally known as theft) is by far the most reported incident type. Some common stolen items include phones, purses, and laptops. Other unusual stolen items include four Monster Red Bulls (Oct. 6, from P&amp;C Fresh), approximately 50 shopping carts (Oct. 9, also from P&amp;C Fresh), a secured stone statue (Oct. 14, from the International Lounge), an eight-foot ladder (Oct. 26, from 2 Forest Park Lane), and copper pipes (Nov. 14, Appel Commons boiler room). The Red Bulls and ladder were recovered intact.</p>

			<p> When sorted by location, Barton Hall, <a href="http://projects.cornellsun.com/projects/survey/html/correlations.html">Mary Donlon Hall</a>, and the Cornell Store have the most reported incidents (16, 10, and 10 incidents, respectively). All but one report at the Cornell Store had to do with larceny. There was one case of aggravated assault on staff through harassing emails and telephone messages (Oct. 26). Writing on bathroom walls is still a popular sport and considered "criminal mischief". Graffiti is reported in Snee Hall and Olin Library. The famous <a href="http://cornellsun.com/2017/09/16/former-fraternity-house-vandalized-following-possible-hate-crime/">"You Rasist Fucks [sic]"</a> graffiti at the former Psi Upsilon's fraternity house was not logged. There were 91 incidents reported on campus, 67 incidents reported in dormitories or other residential facilities, and 17 incidents reported off campus.

			<h3> About the Data </h3>
			<p> The Cornell Crime Logs are erased past two months from the current date. For this reason, there is only data from about two months ago as of today. If you are interested in contributing to the dataset or this project, please contact me at beatricezjin (at) gmail (dot) com, or visit the Github <a href="https://github.com/bzjin/Cornell-Crime-Logs">page</a> for this project. The full dataset used in this visualization is available <a href="https://github.com/bzjin/Cornell-Crime-Logs/blob/master/data/crimelogs.csv">here</a>. Thanks to Edy for helping collect coordinates of over a hundred locations in Ithaca. </p>

			<p> This is an independent project, with no affiliation to Cornell University or the Cornell University Police Department. It does not condone the use of law enforcement authority to police student lives. The police state will always have its origins in <a href="http://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/brief-history-slavery-and-origins-american-policing">white supremacy</a> and brutalizing black lives. There is no profit or compensation in any form involved in its creation or publication.</p>
